# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

## Objective
Understand and implement KNN for classification on the Iris dataset.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Steps
1. Loaded the Iris dataset using scikit-learn.
2. Normalized features using StandardScaler.
3. Split data into training and test sets (80/20 split).
4. Trained KNN classifiers with K = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.
5. Evaluated models using accuracy and confusion matrix.
6. Plotted accuracy against different K values.

## Results
- Observed how accuracy changes with K.
- Visualized confusion matrices for each K.
